# TMDB CLI Tool

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that allows you to interact with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to retrieve movie information.

## Features

The application allows you to display different types of movie data from TMDB by using the following commands:

1. **Playing Movies**: Display movies currently playing in theaters.
2. **Popular Movies**: Display the most popular movies.
3. **Top Movies**: Display the top-rated movies.
4. **Upcoming Movies**: Display movies that are coming soon.

### Available Commands

- `tmdb-app --type "playing"`: Shows movies currently playing.
- `tmdb-app --type "popular"`: Shows popular movies.
- `tmdb-app --type "top"`: Shows top-rated movies.
- `tmdb-app --type "upcoming"`: Shows upcoming movies.

## Requirements

To run the CLI application, you will need the following:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 5.0 or higher)
- A valid **TMDB API Key**. You can obtain your key by creating an account on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and following their API documentation.
